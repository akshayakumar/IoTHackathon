Beginner Level:

Following section has some references to Python programs that uses Cisco API.
After complete the excercise in "Cisco Spark" you are now familiar with Cisco Spark Environment and Cisco Spark API.

Not lets look at how we can use simple Python to create simple programs using Cisco Spark API.
If you dont have Python installed in local machine you can use any Online python compiler. ( Online Python Compiler: https://repl.it/ )


1) Run the Python sample codes from the Python folder - (https://github.com/akshayakumar/IoTHackathon/tree/master/Python)
	#Replace the {access-token} with your personal access token.

2) Write your own Python code to Post message to Spark room - for group, individual(using email-id)

Expert Level

1) Location based services using Cisco CMX:
    
    Cisco CMX is the most popular in Cisco API community since it let us build some cool Location based Apps.. Check out this reference that walks you through the basics on how to incorporate CMX API in Python & Node.js Code & more.. 		https://github.com/geekbleek/CMX_Getting_Started_Code
		
		CMX Use Case 
		•	Location based services, Analytics – WiFi & BLE
		•	Allow for users to check how “crowded” an area (event, line, store, etc) is relative to capacity.
		•	Automate attendance and classroom assignments from mobile device
